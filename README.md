# 🛍️ E-Commerce Product Page
This is a solution to the [E-Commerce Product Page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ecommerce-product-page-UPsZ9MJp6). The result is an e-commerce product page for a sneaker company allowing users to browse an image gallery of the product and add a selected quantity to their cart.

## 🎯 The Challenge
Users should be able to:
- View the **optimal layout** for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See **hover states** for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a **lightbox gallery** by clicking on the large product image
- **Switch** the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- **Add items** to the cart
- **View** the cart and **remove items** from it

Additional Features Added:
- Persistence of cart content upon reload using **local storage**
- **Keyboard** accessibility (e.g. close window using ESC key, navigate through images with arrow keys)
